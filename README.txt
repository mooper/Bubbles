This is an android application, it is very simple.  When you run it, it has a bubble floating on the screen.  There are spikes in the upper right corner that will pop the bubble.  In the lower left corner there is a key, if there is only one bubble out and that bubble travels over the key it will release a second bubble.  To end the application, pop both bubbles against the spikes.  This is the beta version changes and improvements to come soon.
